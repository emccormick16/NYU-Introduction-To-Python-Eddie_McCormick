## 50 States homework
What helped me with this homework was starting out simple and progressively getting more complicated.
I started with a list then realized that it should be combined into a dictionary.
Then I had issues with the print loop function, so I started simple finally was able to get the desired result.
I used python in the terminal to help me with printing the dictionary.
